**C#** is a multiparadigm programming language that supports Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming that was developed by Microsoft as part of the **.NET framework**.

**.NET** is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

With **.NET**, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for `web`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `games`, `IoT`, and more.

## Roadmap

If you're interested in learning **C#**, here's a roadmap that can help guide you through the learning process:

**1. Learn C# Fundaments:**

-   Project Creation.
-   Datatypes.
-   Variables.
-   Arithmetic Operators.
-   Arithmetic Expressions.
-   Strings.
-   Control Structures.
-   Loops.
-   Arrays.
-   Methods.
-   Structs.
-   Build Projects.

**2. Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

-   Fundamentals of OOP.
-   Classes and Objects.
-   Constructors.
-   Inheritance and Polymorphism.
-   Interfaces.
-   Generics.
-   Delegates and Events.
-   Learn SOLID principles.
-   Build Projects.

**3. Collections and Data Structures:**

-   Recursion.
-   Linked List.
-   Bubble Sort.
-   Insertion Sort.
-   Selection Sort.
-   Merge Sort.
-   Quicksort.
-   Stack.
-   Signs Balance.
-   Queue.
-   Tree.
-   Generic Tree.
-   Binary Tree.
-   Hash Table.
-   Heap.
-   Graph.
-   Dijkstra.

**4. Web Development:**

-   `ASP.NET`.
-   Html, CSS & Javascript.
-   Dependency Injection
-   MVC Pattern.
-   `ASP.NET Core`.
-   Razor.
-   Entity Framework (ORM).
-   `ASP.NET Web API`.
-   `ASP.NET Identity`.
-   Build projects.

**5. Learn Functional Programming (FP):**

-   Fundamentals of FP (Immutability, Higher-Order Functions, Pure Functions, and Lambda Expressions).
-   Functional Programming Constructs (Lambda expressions, LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) And Delegates).
-   Functional Data Structures (Linked Lists, Trees, And Maps).
-   Practice `LINQ`.
-   Practice Writing Pure Functions.
-   Practice Recursion.
-   Monads.

**6. Advanced Concepts.**

-   Reflection.
-   Attributes.
-   Threading and Asynchronous Programming.
-   `LINQ`.
-   Memory Management.
-   Design Patterns.

By following this order, you'll build a strong foundation in **C#** and be able to create complex applications with confidence.
