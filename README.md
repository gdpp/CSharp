**C#** is a multiparadigm programming language that supports Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming that was developed by Microsoft as part of the **.NET framework**.

**.NET** is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

With **.NET**, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for `web`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `games`, `IoT`, and more.
